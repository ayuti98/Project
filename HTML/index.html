            <h1 class="heading">5 Programming Languages That Every Developer Should Learn</h1>
            <p class="paraclass">Programmers write code in various general-purpose programming languages. Most programmers who work with enterprise software typically work with one programming language until they retire. However, some programmers get opportunities to work with multiple programming languages during their day-to-day jobs. For example, if a programmer works with a
                 Flutter native module, there is an opportunity to work with Dart, Kotlin (or Java), Objective-C (or Swift), C/C++, etc.</p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="heading1">C/C++</h2>
            <p class="paraclass">The C programming language is the foundation language of almost all low-level software components. C’s abstraction is closer to hardware, and C provides a minimal syntax for programmers (with 32 reserved keywords). C’s syntax is closer to Assembly compared to other modern popular programming languages. Therefore, C compilers
                 translate C source code to machine language efficiently and produce lightweight and blazing fast binary executables.</p>

                <p class="paraclass">WBash is a command language and command-line interpreter built for Unix-like operating systems. The Bash interpreter program is pre-installed into almost all Unix-like operating systems. Also, many GUI Terminal software typically uses Bash as the default command interpreter.
                     Therefore, we can write portable Bash scripts for different Unix-like operating systems.</p>

                <p class="paraclass">WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) is now JavaScript — not Java. Now you can use JavaScript to build literally anything. You can build websites, web services, desktop apps, mobile apps, CLI programs, IoT solutions, robotics-related programs, and smart TV apps with JavaScript. There is even a runtime (NodeOS) that natively supports JavaScript and npm modules. If you learn JavaScript, 
                    you get an amazing opportunity to work with various software projects.</p>

            <h2 class="heading1">Go</h2>
            <p class="paraclass">
                Go is a statically typed general-purpose programming language designed with C-like syntax. It comes with many features that other modern programming languages have such as, garbage collection, memory safety, and concurrency support. The Go programming language has a developer-friendly syntax but still has an impressive performance compared
                 to other popular languages. The design of the Go language teaches us a lot of valuable lessons for all programmers.
